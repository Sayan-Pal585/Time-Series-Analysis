Intermittent Time Series:

Intermittent time series have a large number of values that are zero. These types of series commonly occur in Internet, inventory, sales, and other data where the demand 
for a particular item is intermittent. Typically, when the value of the series associated with a particular time period is nonzero, demand occurs; and when the value is zero 
(or missing), no demand occurs. Since it is entirely possible that the number of time periods for which no demand occurs is large, many of the series values are zero. 
Typical time series models (for example, smoothing models) are inadequate in the case of intermittent time series because many of the series values are zero. Since these models
are based on weighted-summations of past values, they bias forecasts away from zero. Unlike the smoothing models that provide forecasts for future time periods, 
intermittent forecasting models provide recommended stocking levels or estimated demand per period that are used to satisfy future demand.

Methods for Intermittent Demand Forecasting
1 Introduction
1.1 What is intermittent demand?
Intermittent demand or ID (also known as sporadic demand) comes about when a product experiences several periods
of zero demand. Often in these situations, when demand occurs it is small, and sometimes highly variable in size.
ID is often experienced in industries such as aviation, automotive, defence and manufacturing; it also typically
occurs with products nearing the end of their life cycle. Some companies operating in these areas observe ID for over
half the products in their inventories. In such situations there is a clear financial incentive to inventory control and
retaining proper stock levels, and therefore to forecasting demand for these items.
1.2 Forecasting difficulties
The many zero values in ID time-series render usual forecasting methods difficult to apply. For example, single
exponential smoothing (SES), proposed in 1956, was the first forecasting method to be applied to intermittent
demand. The forecast of demand in the next period is a weighted average between two quantities, defined:
Ft+1 = αXt + (1 − α)Ft
where Ft denotes the forecast for time period t, Xt denotes the actual demand observed in period t, and α is a
smoothing parameter which can be adjusted between 0 and 1. Higher α will produce a forecast which is more
responsive to recent changes in the data, whilst also being less robust to noise.
Unfortunately, SES is known to perform poorly in forecasting for ID, since there is an upward bias in the forecast
in the period directly after a non-zero demand. Can we develop specific forecasting methods for ID that do better?
This report explores a few different classes of method, and also discusses some error metrics used to evaluate them.
2 Ad-hoc forecasting methods
The ad-hoc class of forecasting methods are not underpinned by theoretical results. However, it is often the case that
such methods can be demonstrated to give good, robust forecasts through empirical experiments and practical use.
These methods are, therefore, useful, and are the methods most used in industry today.
2.1 Croston’s method
The first ID-specific method was proposed by Croston [1]. His insight was that estimating demand probability (via
interval size) and demand size separately was more intuitive and accurate. Let Zt be the estimate of mean non-zero
demand size for time t, Vt the estimate of mean interval size between non-zero demands. Xt again denotes actual
demand observed at time t, and q is the current number of consecutive zero-demand periods. Yt will denote an
estimate of mean demand size (ie. taking zero demands into the calculation). Then:
If Xt 6= 0 then



Zt+1 = αXt + (1 − α)Zt
Vt+1 = αq + (1 − α)Vt
Yt+1 =
Zt+1
Vt+1
If Xt = 0 then



Zt+1 = Zt
Vt+1 = Vt
Yt+1 = Yt
Croston showed that this process gave significantly better forecasts than SES for some ID data.

There are limitations to this method; the first is bias. Croston argued that for such estimates Vt and Zt
, Yt+1
as a forecast for the demand next period would be unbiased. However, Syntetos and Boylan [6] showed that, since
E[X¯
t
] = E[

Vt
] 6= E[Zt
]

E[Vt]
, bias is, in fact, present. Additional drawbacks include the lack of independent smoothing
parameters for demand size and interval size, the assumption that demand size and demand interval are independent
(this is generally too strong), and there is no way to deal with product obsolescence.
2.2 Adjusted Croston methods
Many adaptations of Croston’s method have been suggested to deal with some of the aforementioned issues. In [6],
the authors propose an adjustment, known as the Syntetos-Boylan Approximation (SBA), to Croston’s forecast Yt
,
namely that it should be multiplied by a factor of (1 −
α
2
), and claim that the new forecast will be approximately
unbiased, since

A method incorporating the possibility of item obsolescence (where an item is no longer demanded at all) is offered by
Teunter et al. [7]. It differs from Croston’s method and SBA in that it estimates the probability of non-zero demand
(rather than interval size), and in that the estimates are updated every period, rather than just when demand occurs.
Let Dt be an indicator of a non-zero demand at time t, Pt the estimate of demand for time period t. The Teunter,
Syntetos and Babai (TSB) method is:
If Dt = 1 then



Pt+1 = β(1) + (1 − β)Pt
Zt+1 = αXt + (1 − α)Zt
Yt+1 = Pt+1Zt+1
If Dt = 0 then



Pt+1 = (1 − β)Pt
Zt+1 = Zt
Yt+1 = Pt+1Zt+1
Note that different smoothing parameters α and β are used here for smoothing demand size and demand probability.
The key advantage of this method is that updating the forecasts at each time period (whether demand occurs
or not) allows the estimate Pt to approach zero if there is a long run of periods without demand. By contrast, the
interval estimate calculated by Croston’s would remain unchanged. In a practical setting, TSB allows decisions to be
taken over whether to continue to stock items or not. One idea might be to set some threshold for p, such that if it
is exceeded (just once or for a number of consecutive periods) it would be decided that the product is now obsolete.
A second, different method dealing with obsolescence was proposed recently by Prestwich et al. [5] and is known
as Hyperbolic Exponential Smoothing (HES). The method combines the Croston method with a Bayesian approach
to derive a new forecast, where if Zt and Vt are the smoothed estimates of demand size and interval length, and Tt
is
the current number of periods since a demand was last seen, then
Ft =
Zt
Vt + β
Tt
2
is the forecast for time t. Note β is the smoothing parameter for interval length. The main difference between TSB
and HES is that HES decays hyperbolically over a series of zeros, whereas TSB decays only exponentially.

Intermittent demand forecasting is crucial for firms and commercial activities. Recently, many researchers have focused on forecasting methods for intermittent demand and 
proposed various forecasting techniques. The most prominent methods among these proposed techniques are the Croston method, which is based on exponential smoothing, 
and its two popular variations: SBA (Syntetos-Boylan Approximation), SBJ (Shale-Boylan-Johnston Approximation). Croston method is widely used in forecasting of 
intermittent demand and inventory (stock) control. Since these demands usually include zero values, using the ground breaking method developed by Croston in this data 
becomes inevitable. Nevertheless, there are some shortcomings to this method such as producing biased forecasts and for this reason its variations have been proposed. 
ATA method is a recently developed forecasting method which is an alternative to exponential smoothing. In this paper we propose a modification of ATA method that 
be used for forecasting of intermittent demand. We will compare the results of the proposed approach to those of Croston and other forecasting methods used for intermittent 
demand forecasting.
