How to create an ABC XYZ inventory classification model

The ABC XYZ inventory classification model is built on top of ABC inventory analysis and helps you keep better control of stock by examining demand variability.

As everyone who works in ecommerce will know, stock-outs on your key lines can have a massive negative impact on sales and your marketing costs. In many cases, 
you’ll be paying a pound or so to get every visitor onto your site via your paid search ads, so if they land on your product page and the product they want is out of stock, 
you’ll be burning money.

Most of the customers who land on a product page and find a product out of stock will bounce and go back to Google to find another retailer who has what they want available 
to buy right now.

While some stock-outs are always inevitable and unavoidable, there are several ways procurement managers can keep their stock under tighter control to help reduce the 
likelihood of expensive stock-outs on the lines that contribute the most or are hardest to control.

Inventory management in ecommerce
ABC inventory management is the classic approach to managing stock. This calculates the revenue generated by each SKU and ranks its cumulative percentage contribution 
to the total revenue generated from all SKUs.

As it’s based on the Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, the products generating the top 80% of your revenue are assigned to Class A and get close observation to prevent 
stock-outs because they generate so much. The next 10% of revenue-generating SKUs get assigned to Class B and get slightly less control, while the ones in Class C don’t 
generate much and can be spared the granular level of control given to the As and Bs.

While ABC inventory management is extremely effective, there’s more to controlling stock than simply having the most popular lines in stock to sell.

Sometimes demand for items can change over time, is seasonal, or is subject to changes in demand caused by product lifecycle, economic factors, competitor activity, or 
marketing promotions. These drivers all impact the ability to forecast demand for the affected SKUs, making costly stock-outs much more likely.

This is where XYZ inventory management comes in. Unlike ABC inventory management, which looks at the revenue contribution of each SKU, XYZ inventory management classifies SKUs 
according to the variability of their demand. When demand for products is fairly constant forecasting is relatively straightforward. However, when it’s subject to variation 
demand forecasting becomes a challenge - or a nightmare.

How XYZ inventory management works
With XYZ inventory management, the sales demand for each SKU is measured over a long period of time, in order to capture seasonal variations in demand, then the variance is 
calculated for each SKU and scores are ranked according to their variability.

Class X: Products assigned to Class X are those which show the least variation in demand. Sales of these products are fairly constant, which means they’re easier for procurement
managers to forecast and stock outs should be straightforward to avoid.

Class Y: Products assigned to Class Y are more variable than those in Class X. Demand can change over time, due to factors like seasonality, so they’re harder to accurately 
forecast.

Class Z: Finally, Class Z products are highly variable. Demand goes up and down and is really hard to predict, so avoid stock outs can be really challenging, unless you sit on 
large stocks that may not turnover quickly.

Combining ABC and XYZ
Since both ABC inventory management and XYZ inventory management both tackle different things and are both extremely useful to operations managers or procurement staff, 
they’re often combined as ABC-XYZ inventory management.

Here, as the name suggests, the ABC class and the XYZ class assignation for each SKU is concatenated to form AX, AY, AZ, BX, BY, BZ, CX, CY, and CZ classes that help managers 
understand both the importance to revenue and the variation in demand.

In this project we’re going to use a 12 month snapshot of ecommerce transactional data to create an ABC-XYZ inventory management model which classifies each SKU, and proposes 
some recommendations for their management to help the retailer avoid too many costly stock-outs.

Understanding the ABC XYZ classes

By combining the ABC and XYZ data we generate nine distinct classes. The Classes with an A prefix all contribute high amounts of revenue, the B Classes contribute medium 
revenue and the C Classes contribute low revenue.

Similarly, the X suffixed Classes have steady demand and are easy to forecast and manage. The Y suffixed Classes have variable but predictable demand so are harder to manage 
than the X Classes, but still easily doable. The Z Classes are the toughest of all. They’re sold sporadically and in varying volumes, so they’re harder to forecast and harder to manage.

Chances are, your operations and procurement team will already understand how to apply ABC XYZ inventory classification, given that it’s the industry standard and is included 
within major platforms such as SAP.
